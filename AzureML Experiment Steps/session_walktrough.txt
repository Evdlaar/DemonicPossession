- Datasets
- New dataset -> upload posession dataset
- Experiments
- Blank experiment
- Import uploaded posession dataset
- Visualize dataset -> note graphs, missing values and string data types
- Edit metadata -> with rules -> all features
  -> Data type "String" -> Make categorical
- Save and run
- Visualize edit metadata
- Clean Missing Data
  -> Remove entire row
- Save and run
- Check results, notice rowcount
- Split data
  -> 0,9 split / 1234 Random seed
- Train model
  -> Column name "possesed"
- Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree
  -> Random seed 1234
- Score model
- Evaluate model
- Save and run -> takes about 40 sec
- Check out the Score model results
- Check out Evaluate model results

- Add Two-Class Support Vector Machine
  -> Random seed 1234
- Add Train Model
  -> Column name "possesed"
- Add Score model
  -> Attach to second input of Evaluate Model
- Save and run

- Remove Train Model from the Two-Class SVM
- Add Tune Model Hyperparameters
  -> Select "possesed" column / Max runs 10 / 1234 random seed / measure on Accuracy
  -> Attach to the SVM
  -> Attach the "trained best model" to Score model
- Save and run
- Check Tune Model Hyperparameters
- Check Evaluate Model results

- Set up web service
- Add Select Columns in Dataset
- Remove line between Score Model and Web service output
- Connect Select Columns in Dataset to Score model and Web service output
- In column selector include "Scored Labels"
- Save and run
- Deploy web service (classic)
