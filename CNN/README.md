# Demonic Possession Graphical Detection

The code is stored inside the .zip file and includes the images and the training data set.

# Setup

- Download the .zip file
- Create a folder named "R" on your C: drive
  (alternatively you can modify all the filepaths in the code to a directory of your choosing)
- Unzip the contents of the .zip file to the C:\R folder.
  You should end up with a folder structure of C:\R\Posession where the main .R file resides.
- Run through the code in the Possession_classification.R file.
  Many comments are present in the file itself explaining what it is doing.
